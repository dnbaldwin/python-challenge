# python-challenge
bootcamp Module 3 Challenge

Two challenge projects are included:

1. PyBank

2. PyPoll


For both programs, the code is run using main.py. The datafile needs to be in a subdirectory /Resources. Output of the analysis will be to another subdirectory /Analysis. Results are also provided in the terminal.

It was a little unclear to me, what exact analysis was being requested for the PyBank challenge. As my results differ from the expected output, it is clear that part of the analysis is deficient / incorrect.

The PyPoll analysis appears to accurately reproduce the expected result and is should therefore be error free.

I studied responses to queries in forums below to problem solve aspects of the code, such as performing the same operation on all members of a list, and how to format data as $ formatting.

The code provided however was written in its entirety by me.
